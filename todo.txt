Dolphins @ Jaguars

Shallow analysis from looking at the DVOA percentages. 

Offense: Jaguars clearly have the better offense in this matchup.

Dolphins offense is average. Seems like the passing game is more efficient than the their rushing game. 

Jaguars offense on the other hand is pretty pass heavy but also pose a decent rushing game.

Defense: Both defenses are pretty bad.

Dolphins run and pass defenses are pretty bad. Their run defense is not as bad as their pass defense though.

Jaguars run defense is a mile better than their pass defense.
