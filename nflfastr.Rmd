## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r install}
install.packages("nflfastR")
install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("RSQLite")
```

```{r load}
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
```

```{r load schedule}
schedule <- fast_scraper_schedules(2020)
```

```{r packers schedule}
gb_home <- schedule %>% filter(home_team ==  'GB')
gb_away <- schedule %>% filter(away_team == 'GB')
gb_full <- rbind(gb_home, gb_away)
gb_gameids <- gb_full %>% select(game_id)
```

```{r epa}
pbp_df <- build_nflfastR_pbp(unlist(gb_gameids))
```

```{r calculate home epa}
gb_home_offense_df <- pbp_df %>% filter(home_team == 'GB') %>% filter(posteam == 'GB')
gb_away_offense_df <- pbp_df %>% filter(away_team == 'GB') %>% filter(posteam == 'GB')

home_offense_epa_play <- sum(gb_home_offense_df %>% select(epa)) / gb_home_offense_df %>% count()
away_offense_epa_play <- sum(gb_away_offense_df %>% select(epa)) / gb_away_offense_df %>% count()
```

```{r temp}

temp_pbp <- fast_scraper(unlist(gb_gameids))

```

```{r opponent epa}
team_epa <- function(team) {
  team_gameids <- schedule %>% filter(home_team == team | away_team == team) %>% select(game_id)
  team_pbp_df <- build_nflfastR_pbp(unlist(team_gameids))
  
  team_offense <- team_pbp_df %>% filter(posteam == team)
  team_defense <- team_pbp_df %>% filter(defteam == team)
  
  offense_epa_play <- sum(team_offense %>% select(epa)) / team_offense %>% count()
  defense_epa_play <- sum(team_defense %>% select(epa)) / team_defense %>% count()
  
  c(team, offense_epa_play, defense_epa_play)
}
